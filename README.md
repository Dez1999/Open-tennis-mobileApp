# About this repo

OpenTennis is a mobile application that has the capability to calculate and display the occupancy status for people at facilities in real-time. 

The openTennis React Native mobile application follows a role-based access control system for multiple users. The main users are the General users and the Manager users. This application is the frontend part of a system to allow users to view the current occupancy of specific places in real time. The frontend uses custom APIs to implement core functionalities. 

The mobile application allows managers to create new facilities, and add new devices in order to monitor areas. General users are able to search for specific facilities and they have the ability to filter by city, range, occupancy status and type of facility (Tennis, Basketball, Swimming).
